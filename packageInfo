S5cmd S3A FileSystem for Hadoop
============================

This package provides a custom implementation of the Hadoop S3AFileSystem that uses s5cmd
for S3 uploads, which can significantly improve performance compared to the default AWS SDK
implementation.

Key Features:
- Uses s5cmd for high-performance S3 uploads
- Supports multipart uploads for large files
- Configurable temporary directory for intermediate files
- Support for additional s5cmd arguments
- Compatible with standard Hadoop S3A configuration

Configuration Options:
- fs.s3a.impl = org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.custom.S5cmdS3AFileSystem
- fs.s3a.s5cmd.path = Path to s5cmd executable (default: "s5cmd")
- fs.s3a.s5cmd.temp.dir = Directory for temporary files (default: system temp dir)
- fs.s3a.s5cmd.additional.args = Additional arguments to pass to s5cmd
- fs.s3a.s5cmd.multipart.threshold = Threshold for multipart uploads in bytes (default: 100MB)
